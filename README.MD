# Floquet Time Crystal Simulation

The code in this folder simulates a many-body localized Floquet time crystal in a spin chain with nearest-neighbor Ising interactions.  

## Running the Solvers

The solver is self-contained within the "main.m" file. To run, simply change the desired parameters in the "main.m" code as necessary and hit run.
